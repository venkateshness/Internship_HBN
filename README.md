# This project has been started as a part-time project during the 3rd semester of my masters program and has been continued as part of the final-year internship

# Commonalities:
  * Dataset: 
    * Source: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/
    * Characteristics: 
        * Number of Electrodes (no. of channels) : 128
        * Sampling Frequency: 500hz
        * Duration: ~352.77 seconds
        * Total samples = Duration X Sampling Frequency -> 176386
        * Dimension = (total samples, no. of channels)
        * Events (States during the EEG): 90, 20, 30 which represents start of the recording, eyes-open and eyes-closed respectively
        * Subjects: NDARBF805EHN, NDARBG574KF4 (from https://partage.imt.fr/index.php/s/97wDFxzLQ5NgkNJ *not* on HBN link)
  * Resource (Project-related): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkX0Mfeq030oCQQDL4xb87XxXjqXyLqncg1FA7nANp0
  * A UE (Useful resources): https://github.com/brain-bzh/health_exg
  * Tool: https://mne.tools/stable/index.html, among other typical data-manipulating packages
  

# Details related to the project as part-time:
### Goal: EEG-data
  * Source Signal Reconstruction (Activation region's)
  * Inter-subjects Study = End goal
  
# Details related to the project as full-time (internship)
### Goal: (Subjected to change)
 * Integration of EEG-fMRI for the inter-subjects Study 
 * Exploiting Graph Signal Processing to understand the neuronal connectomes
### Features:
 * Dataset:
   * Events: 83, 103 (Video-watching starts and ends respectively)
