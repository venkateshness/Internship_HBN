# Global View:
  * Dataset: 
    * Source: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/cmi_healthy_brain_network/
    * Characteristics: 
        * Number of Electrodes (no. of channels) : 128
        * Sampling Frequency: 500hz
        * Duration: ~352.77 seconds
        * Total samples = Duration X Sampling Frequency -> 176386
        * Dimension = (total samples, no. of channels)
        * Events (States during the EEG): 90, 20, 30 which represents start of the recording, eyes-open and eyes-closed respectively
        * Subjects: NDARBF805EHN, NDARBG574KF4 (from https://partage.imt.fr/index.php/s/97wDFxzLQ5NgkNJ *not* on HBN link)

  * A UE (Useful resources): https://github.com/brain-bzh/health_exg
  * Tool: https://mne.tools/stable/index.html, among other typical data-manipulating packages
  
  
# Goal: Of two folds
  * Source Signal Reconstruction (Activation region's)
  * Inter-subjects Study = End goal
